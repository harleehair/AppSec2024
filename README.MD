<h2>Introduction</h2>

Hello, this is a simple static website with 5 html pages, 4 images, and a css file.

All html pages are stored in the templates folder, while the css and images are stored in the static file. The images are original work.

I was able to run and preview each page successfully on my machine by using the flask preview option. 
I was also able to run this through gitpod once I installed a python extension and installed flask. 

I followed a very helpful and basic tutorial to understand how flask applications. [Here is the link to the playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e4STDACVA8&list=PLCC34OHNcOtqJBOLjXTd5xC0e-VD3siPn)

<h2>Description</h2>

  - A base hmtl file is made, with basic information, css file linked, and the navigation bar set up. I used code from bootcamp to create the navi bar. 
  - The index file is the home page, previewing the four images. 
  - The About me file shows a title and three paragraphs. I used Lorem Ipsum to generate the text. 
  - The Contact file acts as a way to contact the website. It reponds to all three text boxes being filled in. If that is true, it will return a new html page called form, showing what the user submitted. 
      - Example= name email : message.
  - The Contact file also responds to when the user does not fill out all boxes. If the user hits the submit button with one or more boxes empty, it will reload the page and present a closable error at the top of the page. This code was also from bootcamp. 

An interesting problem I have is that these input boxes change size based on the previously mentioned interacton. The input boxes have no set deminsion and load from one end of the browser to the other. If the user fails to fill out a box, having the page reload, the input boxes are no longer end to end. They look more uniform and clean. I liked that and could not figure out how to make that a standard feature for the contact html page. 

Please contact me if something fails to load. 

Thank you!
