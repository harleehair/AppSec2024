Hello, this is a simple static website with 4 html pages and 1 base html that the others depend on. 

There is a main index page, an about page, a contact page, and a form page that returns what the user submitted in the contact page.

All html pages are stored in the templates folder, while the css and images are stored in the static file. The images are original work.

I was able to run and preview each page successfully on my machine and by using the flask preview option. 
I was also able to run this through gitpod once I installed a python extension and installed flask. 

I followed a very helpful and basic tutorial to understand how flask and html files can work together. 

  A base hmtl file is made, with basic information, css file linked, and the navigation bar set up. I used code from bootcamp. 
  The index file is the home page, holding four images. 
  The About me file shows a title and three paragraphs. I used Lorem Ipsum to generate the text.
